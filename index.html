                                        <br>  2. Landfill: Plastic waste is buried in underground landfills to minimize the direct impact on the environment. However, burying cannot completely solve the environmental problems caused by plastic waste, and it also occupies a lot of land resources.
                                        <br>3. Discharge into the sea: Some of the plastic waste may be put into the sea, leading to the pollution of the marine ecosystem. In response to this situation, a number of studies have been devoted to cleaning up plastic waste in the ocean and exploring ways to prevent further pollution.
                                        <br> Scientists are also promoting a circular economy model that minimizes the generation of plastic waste by designing products and packaging to be more easily recyclable. Scientists are continually working on research to find more environmentally friendly and sustainable ways of disposing of plastic waste to minimize the damage caused to the environment.</p>

                            <p class="fw_300">Plastic bottles are a common type of container, usually used to contain liquid and solid food and beverages. Plastic bottles are widely used in daily life as they are lightweight, easy to carry and easy to clean. Plastic bottles will come in different shapes, sizes and colors. In addition, plastic bottles can be recycled and recovered, helping to reduce the environmental impact of plastic waste. After polluting the environment, this "white trash", which is difficult to degrade, is flowing into rivers and oceans, changing the marine ecosystem and even entering the food chain, causing more harm to humans. Next I am going to introduce my report with the following points: the production of plastic bottles, the benefits and social impacts of plastic bottles, negative impacts, solutions, and summary.</p>

                            <h4 class="fw_700 pb_25">Description of plastics</h4>
                            <p class="fw_300">Plastic bottles are usually made from plastic materials such as polyethylene (PET) or polypropylene (PP). Before production, these plastic materials need to be mixed in certain proportions and pre-treated in granular form for subsequent processing and use. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a transparent plastic material commonly used in the manufacture of beverage bottles and food containers. It has good transparency and heat resistance. The steps involved in the production of plastic bottles are as follows: The production process of plastic bottles usually includes the following steps:
                               <br> 1. raw material preparation
                               <br> 2. injection molding
                               <br> 3. cooling and curing
                               <br> 4. cutting and shaping
                               <br> 5. surface treatment
                               <br> 6. Quality inspection
                               <br>7. Packing and packaging</p>

                                <li class="fw_300"><span class="fw_700 color_22 text-uppercase"></span>Plastic bottles are widely used to bring many conveniences to life, firstly, they are light and easy to carry, which is convenient for storing and carrying drinking water; secondly, the production cost of plastic bottles is low and the production efficiency is high, which makes drinking water and other items more popular and cheaper; at the same time, the durability of plastic bottles makes it possible to keep liquids for a long time, which is good for merchandising and warehouse management.PET and glass bottles can be recycled but PET is light and easy to carry while glass bottles can be recycled several times but are heavier and not suitable for carrying. PET and glass bottles are both recyclable, but PET bottles are lightweight, easy to carry, and easy to recycle, while glass bottles can be reused many times, but are heavier, easier to break, and not suitable for carrying.PET has a lower impact on the environment, while glass bottles have a higher energy consumption in the production process. As a result, more and more companies are using plastic bottles instead of glass. While enjoying the convenience of plastic bottles, we should also focus on reducing the amount of use and reasonable disposal of waste to protect the environment and ecological sustainable and healthy development.</li>

Difficulty in disposal: It is very difficult to dispose of plastic bottles in the environment. As plastic bottles are not easily degraded, they exist in soil, rivers and oceans for a long time, seriously affecting the balance of the ecosystem.
                                    <br> 2. Harm to human body: Chemicals in plastic bottles may leak out and be absorbed by the human body. harmful substances in some plastic bottles.
                                    <br> 3. Impact on the environment: The production and disposal of plastic bottles require a lot of energy and resources, causing an environmental burden. Moreover, a large amount of plastic waste is difficult to be recycled and disposed of effectively, which directly affects the purity of the atmosphere, soil and water quality, and aggravates the problem of environmental pollution.
                                    <br> 4. Harmful to animals: animals accidentally eating plastic bottles may lead to suffocation, damage to the digestive system or even death. Plastic garbage in the ocean causes serious harm to marine organisms. Misuse of plastic bottles triggers internal injuries, seriously threatening their living environment.
                                    <br> 5. Air Pollution: Plastic products are difficult to degrade, and when plastic is incinerated it releases a large amount of toxic gases, polluting the air and causing harm to human health and the environment.</li>
